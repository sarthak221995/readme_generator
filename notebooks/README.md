## Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of Multi-Agent Systems using the CrewAI framework. It provides a collection of Jupyter Notebooks illustrating how to leverage multiple agents to perform diverse tasks, automating processes across various domains.

## Features

*   **Multi-Agent System Implementation:** Demonstrates the creation and orchestration of multiple intelligent agents using CrewAI.
*   **Modular Design:** The use of separate Jupyter Notebooks for different use cases promotes modularity and allows for easy extension of the system.
*   **Environment Variable Management:** Utilizes `.env` files for secure storage and management of API keys and other sensitive information.
*   **API Integration:** Integrates with external APIs such as OpenAI and Serper, enabling agents to access a wide range of information and capabilities.
*   **Task Automation:** Automates complex tasks such as customer support, financial analysis, and project planning through multi-agent collaboration.
*   **Output Formatting:** Includes utility functions to improve the readability of the output generated by the agents.
*   **Diverse Use Cases:** Covers a wide range of applications, including customer campaigns, customer support, event planning, financial analysis, project planning, job application tailoring, article writing, and sales pipeline management.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sarthak221995/Multi-Agent-Systems-with-CrewAI.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Multi-Agent-Systems-with-CrewAI
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install crewai openai python-dotenv serper
    ```

    If the notebooks require other packages, install them using pip as well.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    *   Create a `.env` file in the directory *above* the cloned repo's directory (very important).  This is crucial for security, preventing API keys from being committed to the repository.
    *   Add the following lines to the `.env` file, replacing the placeholders with your actual API keys:

        ```
        OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
        SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_SERPER_API_KEY
        ```

    *   Obtain API keys from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and [Serper](https://serper.dev/).

5.  **Run the Jupyter Notebooks:**

    *   Start Jupyter Notebook:

        ```bash
        jupyter notebook
        ```

    *   Navigate to the project directory in the Jupyter Notebook interface.
    *   Open and run the desired `.ipynb` notebooks.

## Usage

The project contains several Jupyter Notebooks, each showcasing a specific use case. Here's a brief overview:

*   `agent_for_customer_campaign.ipynb`: Demonstrates how to use agents for customer campaigns.
*   `agent_for_customer_support.ipynb`: Shows how to implement a multi-agent system for customer support.
*   `agent_for_event_planning.ipynb`: Illustrates how agents can be used for event planning, utilizing `venue_details.json` for venue information.
*   `agent_for_financial_analysis.ipynb`: Demonstrates financial analysis using agents.
*   `agent_for_project_planning.ipynb`: Shows how to use agents for project planning.
*   `agent_for_project_progress_report.ipynb`: Illustrates agents creating project progress reports.
*   `agent_to_tailor_job_application.ipynb`: Demonstrates how to tailor job applications using agents.
*   `agent_to_write_an_article.ipynb`: Shows how agents can be used to write articles.
*   `agentic_sales_pipeline.ipynb`: Illustrates agents managing a sales pipeline.

**Example: Loading API Keys**

The `utils.py` file provides helper functions for loading API keys from environment variables:

```python
from utils import get_openai_api_key, get_serper_api_key

openai_api_key = get_openai_api_key()
serper_api_key = get_serper_api_key()

print(f"OpenAI API Key: {'*' * (len(openai_api_key) -4 ) + openai_api_key[-4:] if openai_api_key else 'Not Found'}")
print(f"Serper API Key: {'*' * (len(serper_api_key) -4 ) + serper_api_key[-4:] if serper_api_key else 'Not Found'}")
```

**Example: Pretty Printing Results**

The `utils.py` also includes a function for formatting output to improve readability:

```python
from utils import pretty_print_result

long_text = "This is a very long line of text that needs to be wrapped to improve readability."
pretty_print_result(long_text)
```

## API Documentation

### `utils.py`

*   **`get_openai_api_key()`**: Retrieves the OpenAI API key from the environment variables.
*   **`get_serper_api_key()`**: Retrieves the Serper API key from the environment variables.
*   **`pretty_print_result(text: str)`**: Formats the given text to improve readability by wrapping long lines.

## Configuration

The project uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file (in the directory *above* the cloned repo's directory) and define the following variables:

*   `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.
*   `SERPER_API_KEY`: Your Serper API key.

**Important Note:** Ensure the `.env` file is located in the directory *above* the cloned repository to prevent accidental commits of your API keys.  This is a standard security practice.
